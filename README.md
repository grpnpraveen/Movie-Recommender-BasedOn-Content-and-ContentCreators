## Abstract
The main aim of this project is to recommend the best movies that gives the same vibe as the movie the user likes. The movie that user likes will be taken as the input and the best movies will be shown to the user from the database which are similar to the input movie, this process happens using knowledge graphs and natural language processing. In this process the recommendation happens based on content and content creators i.e., genre of the movie, the main plot of the movie, directors, and writers of the movie.
